## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-reandom amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The variable would be vehicle length

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? why or why not?
The slope of the linear model would not be zero.

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MeachaCar pototypes effectively? Why not why not?
Unfortunately, the model does not predict the mpg effectively. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
After looking over the data, you can tell that two of the lots, lot 1 and lot 2  are simialar. Unfortuantely, lot 3 does not meet the specificaiton.
